# myPark - A Parking Reservation System

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For your local development environment, you will need Node.js. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies, including React, get installed with:

```npm install```

Run this command before you start your application for the first time. Next, you can start the app with:

```npm run dev```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console (use Google Chrome).

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

# SoPra FS22 - Client Template

## Getting started

Read and go through these Tutorials. It will make your life easier!

- Read the React [Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- Do this React [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) Tutorial (it doesnâ€™t assume any existing React knowledge)
- Get an Understanding of [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/), [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax), and [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)!

Next, there are two other technologies that you should look at:

* [react-router-dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) offers declarative routing for React. It is a collection of navigational components that fit nicely with the application. 
* [react-hooks](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Hooks) let you access the router's state and perform navigation from inside your components.

## Prerequisites and Installation
For your local development environment, you will need Node.js. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies, including React, get installed with:

```npm install```

Run this command before you start your application for the first time. Next, you can start the app with:

```npm run dev```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console (use Google Chrome).

### Testing
Testing is optional, and you can run the tests with `npm run test`.
This launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

> For macOS user running into a 'fsevents' error: https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/423

### Build
Finally, `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance: the build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
